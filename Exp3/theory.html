              <b>Thermal cycle of welding:</b><br><br>
              Thermal variation - The temperature of the weld varies from the ambient temperature to above the liquidus temperature (possibly to boiling point and above for some very high energy-density processes).
               The severity of this thermal variation depends on the terms:
                <ol>
                <li>Temperature reached by the workpiece.</li>
                <li>Time required to reach the temperature.</li>
                <li> Hold time at the temperature.</li>
                </ol>

               The effects on structure are completely determined by the above-mentioned points, i.e., the thermal variation leads to changes in microstructural characteristics and distortion.
               To mathematically quantify the thermal cycle, we need temperature distribution in time and space coordinates.<br><br>

               <b>Thermal cycle characterization via thermocouples</b><br><br>

               To find the thermal cycle undergone by a weld bead, an experiment can be performed such that thermocouples are positioned along the weld path at various points. This can be seen schematically in figure 1a
              
               The temperature achieved by the thermocouple is plotted, and it is observed that when the heat source moves along the weld path, the temperature rapidly rises to a peak. The peak temperature is held for a very short time, followed by a rapid drop in temperature once the source has passed by the thermocouple. This variation in the temperature can be seen clearly in the graph shown below (figure 1b)

               The peak temperature and the rest of the thermal cycle reaches a quasi-steady state shortly after the heat from the source begins to be deposited. <br>&nbsp;<br>
               
               <b class="h5">Quasi-steady state</b> means a rate of energy input is balanced with the rate of energy loss or dissipation.

               In a quasi-steady state, isotherms of temperature surrounding a moving heat source remain constant and appear to move with the heat source (away from edges). The isotherms follow an elliptical shape when observed from the top, as shown in figure 2.<br><br>

               <li>The maximum temperatures reached (mP, mQ, mR) decrease with distance from the weld line and occur at increasing times (TmP, TmQ, TmR). The peak temperature, P, can then be plotted as a function of time.</li>
               <li>Peak temperature distinguishes the heating portion of the welding thermal cycle from the cooling portion.  At a certain time interval, when points closest to a weld begin cooling, points further away continue to heat. This phenomenon explains certain aspects of heat-affected zone phase transformations, differential rates of thermal expansion/contraction that lead to thermally induced stresses, and possibly distortion.</li>

               <b>The generalized heat flow equation:</b><br><br>
               An elaborate theoretical analysis of heat flow in welding is carried out using the basic heat flow equation by conducting three dimensions. It was originally observed by Rosenthal that the nature of the temperature field in arc welding is quasi-stationary. It means that although the temperature at a point on the plate changes with time, if we consider the temperature isotherms remain stationary, i.e., the shape of the temperature field around the arc will be the same whatever its position be. This aspect is shown in figure 1. The theoretical analysis involves rewriting this equation of heat conduction in a moving coordinate system with the arc center as the origin. Suitable boundary conditions for cases of thin or thick plates are imposed, and a solution is obtained. Temperature does not vary along the thickness for thin plates, i.e., it is two-dimensional distribution, while it varies along the thickness in the case of thick plates. However, at points somewhat away from the arc, the temperature field becomes two-dimensional, even for moderately thick plates.<br>

               Temperature distribution along a section parallel to the weld shows a steep rise in the beginning and then gradual cooling. The peak temperature which is attained at a particular section plays an important role in deciding whether there will be metallurgical microstructural changes along this section (i.e., the size of the head affected). This information is useful in the calculation of residual stresses and distortion.<br><br>
               For two dimensional case, the peak temperature over a particular transverse section is given by the above analysis by using the simplified Rosenthal's  equation,<br>

                $$\frac{1}{Tp-To}=\frac{\sqrt{2 \pi e} \rho C h y}{H_{net}} + \frac{1}{Tm-To}$$<br>

              Where<br>
              Tp =    Peak temperature (K)<br>
              To =    Initial weldment of the temperature (K)<br>
              e  =    base of natural logarithms = 2.718<br>
              &rho;=    density of the base material (g/mm^3)<br>
               C =    specific heat of the base material (J/g K^-1)<br>
               h =    thickness of the base material (mm)<br>
               y =    0 at the fusion zone boundary and where Tp=Tm <br>
              Tm =    Melting temperature of the material being welded (K)<br>
              $$ H_{net} = \frac{q}{v} $$<br>
              Where,  q = heat or energy (J/s)<br>
              &upsilon; = Welding speed (m/s)<br>
