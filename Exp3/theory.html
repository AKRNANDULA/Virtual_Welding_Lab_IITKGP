                  <li class="h3 text-primary"> Gas welding </li><br>
                  Oxy-fuel welding, popularly known as "Gas Welding," is a heat-generating method that uses the combustion of oxygen and fuel. When properly proportioned inside a hand-held torch or blowpipe, a flame that is extremely hot measuring approximately 3200°C is produced. Many gas combinations are utilized in oxy-fuel welding; however, an oxygen-acetylene mixture is the most common. By altering the volume ratio of oxygen to acetylene via the torch or blowpipe nozzles, the oxyacetylene flame's chemical reaction can be adjusted. <br>
                  The schematic diagram of the parts of a gas welding setup is shown in Fig. 1 below.

                <li class="h3 text-primary">Gas cutting </li><br>
                    The oxy-fuel process of cutting is entirely different from welding. In oxygen-fuel cutting, metal is heated to a red-hot temperature using an oxy-acetylene flame. This is followed by a delivery of a jet of pure oxygen that undergoes an exothermic reaction by oxidation to melt the metal and form the cut. Since oxidation is used to achieve this, only metals that readily oxidize at a high temperature can undergo such oxy-fuel cutting. These metals include low alloy steel and mild steel. Fig.2 below shows the schematic of the gas-cutting process.

                      </center>
                </ul>
                <span class="h3 text-primary">Gas welding process chemistry:</span><br><br>
                \( C_2H_2 \) is the most commonly used welding fuel. It dissociates in the presence of oxygen in the first step of the two-stage process, releasing hydrogen gas, carbon monoxide, and heat.

                $$ O_2 + C_2H_2 = H_2 + 2CO + Heat $$

                Following that, Carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and more oxygen mix in a secondary process to create water vapour and CO2.
                
                $$ 2CO + H_2 + 1.5O_2 = H_2O + 2CO_2 + Heat $$ 

                Combining equations (i) and (ii) shows that one part of acetylene requires roughly two and a half parts of oxygen to be used.
                
                $$ 2.5O_2 + C_2H_2 = H_2O + 2CO_2 + Heat $$
                
                A welder can produce any desired flame condition and temperature by adjusting the relative proportions of acetylene and oxygen. <br><br>

                <span class="h3 text-primary">Different Welding Gases.</span><br> <br>
                Industrial fuel gases have the need for oxygen to enable combustion. A fuel gas must have the following properties when burned with oxygen in order to be suitable for welding operations. <br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>high-temperature flame </li>
                    <li>greater heat propagation rate</li>
                    <li>sufficient content of heat</li>
                </ul>
                Acetylene most closely satisfies all of the above criteria amid the readily available fuel gases in industry, including \( C_3 H_8 \), hydrogen, natural gas, propylene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) hydrogen, and MAPP gas.
                <br><br>
                <span class="h3 text-primary">Acetylene Characteristics:</span> <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>A fundamental ignition region and a subsidiary ignition region are the two stages in which hydrocarbons burn (envelope flame). </li>
                    <li>When mixed with oxygen, the colourless gas acetylene produces an extremely combustible mixture.</li>
                    <li>A combination of calcium carbide and water produces acetylene gas, which has the chemical formula C2H2 and is made up of carbon and hydrogen.</li>
                </ol>
                The other two cutting and joining gases are  <br><br>
                <ul><li>Hydrogen</li> <li>MAPP</li></ul>
                <span class="h4 text-primary">MAPP</span> is a blend of methylacetylene-propadiene and LPG (acetylene and propane). MAPP gas can be used in high-volume acetylene cutting torches capable of cutting steel up to 12 inches thick, at pressures which are substantially greater than those of acetylene, frequently reaching pressures of 40 or 50 psi. <br><br>

                <span class="h4 text-primary">Hydrogen generates</span> low-temperature flames and is compatible with aluminium. Since non-luminous hydrogen flames may be utilized at higher pressures than acetylene, they are widely used for underwater welding.<br><br>
                Gases that are good for cutting yet inappropriate for welding are as follows: <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Methane</li><li>Propane</li><li>Liquified Petroleum Gas</li>
                </ul>
                Due to their oxidizing properties, hydrocarbon gases, including propane, natural gas, butane, municipal gas, and others, are not suitable for welding iron or steel. <br><br>
                <span class="h3 text-primary">Gas Welding Equipment:</span><br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="h4 text-primary">Oxygen cylinder:</span> It is a hollow, closed cylinder that can withstand extremely high pressures,  and it is attached to a safety valve and regulator. Steel cylinders with capacities ranging from 2.25 to 6.3 m3 are used. At 21°C, the cylinders are filled with oxygen at a density of roughly 150 kg/cm2. The knob that operates the valve can open or close the cylinder. To secure the nozzle, a protective cover is provided on the cylinder's top. Fig. 3 below shows a schematic of an oxygen cylinder. <br><br>

The cylinder has a capacity of around 10m3. The safety valve and regulator valve are mounted on the cylinder. Since acetylene is relatively unstable when compressed in free space, the cylinder is not hollow. The cylinder contains porous material that has been saturated with liquid acetone (in a similar manner to a sponge absorbing water). Acetylene gas is injected into the cylinder, where it is absorbed by the soluble acetone (acetone can absorb acetylene many times its volume). Fig. 4a and 4b below shows the schematic representation of the acetylene cylinder and its cross-section.</li>

Two high-pressure valves that control oxygen and acetylene flow to provide a neutral preheating flame is included with the cutting torch. After preheating, a mechanical lever is pulled to release a high-pressure oxygen jet from the central aperture. The diameter of the central aperture of the gas-cutting torch varies with the variation of the thickness of the workpiece.</li>

The oxidizing flame is divided into two zones: the inner zone, which is very bright white and has a temperature of around 3300°C, and the blue outer zone of lower temperature. This flame is used to cut and weld metals that are not much affected by oxidation, including brass, copper, bronze alloys, etc. Fig.7 below is a schematic representation of an oxidizing flame. </li>

The outer envelope of a neutral flame is wider as compared to the small and narrow outer envelope of oxidizing flame. A neutral flame is the most commonly used flame type, typically used for welding steel, cast iron, and other metals. Fig.9 below shows the schematic of the neutral flame.</li>
